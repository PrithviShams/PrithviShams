## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a metallurgical engineer by training, taking my baby steps in the world of data science and web programming. 

I'm a voracious reader of long-form journalism, current affairs, history and political science. I will be very happy the day I publish my first opinion piece in a newspaper of record!
